                        Over the summer I have been working on a simple somewhat puzzle type game in Unreal 4, the game is my
                        way of practicing C++ programming through an engine rather than through the Visual Studio console. This
                        is an in progress project I am working on in the little spare time I get (hence the WIP). The current goal
                        is to for the player to pickup weapons from the floor, switch between them in their inventory and use them
                        to solve puzzles. Each gun has a different projectile effect that applies an effect onto an object, so far 
                        the current effects are; Grow object hit, Shrink object hit and Push object hit. Hopefully it will come
                        together and can be used to navigate a puzzle map similar to the way the Portal games work.

                        At the beginning of my second semester of year 2 we were given a group assignement where we 
                        would collaborate with the game design/art students to create a piece of software or game in 
                        any environment we chose, this project consisted of 10 days from 10am to 5pm (much more like 10pm)
                        where we came into the university labs and worked the on our project. The point of this was to simulate
                        what it would be like in industry and to get a feel for what full time development would be like. 
                        The 10 day period was by far, the best experience I've had at university since I began. We created 
                        a delivery driver simulation game inspired by the annoyance of having Amazon delivery drivers leaving
                        our parcels in obscure spots for us to find.

                        Throughout the project I was tasked with camera controls, player and delivery van interactions as well
                        as the physics throughout the level that handled the driving and terrain. As there was only 2 of us 
                        programming the project I worked on the majority of aspects in the project to some degree. The project 
                        is still being worked on by me and my team in our spare time as we made massive progress during the 10 days
                        and have been inspired to keep going!
